# 📁 Portfolio Manager V0.1.3

I made this project initially for myself as I wanted to showcase my portfolio and have the ability to add/modify and delete entries seemlessly if needed but decided to strip it out and clean it up (somewhat) and make this repo so anybody else can quickly plug this into their own website.

So what is this? It's a web-based Portfolio Manager built with PHP, JavaScript, and HTML/CSS to help you manage and organise your portfolio to showcase to potential clients or employers.

This project is an ongoing one and will inevitably change and be refined over time. There are most certainly issues with this and there are also going to be bugs with this initial release so I'll clean them up when I can. Suggestions and feedback are welcome.
